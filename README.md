# EA2
## Which package does this program demonstrate?
This program demonstrates the usage of ***Electron*** (with aid of HTML) to create a browser interface, allowing the user to interact with colored buttons

## How do I run this program?
Download **main.js**, **index.html** and **package.json** after which you should run **npm install electron --save-dev** and then to run the program simply type **npm run start**

## What purpose does this program serve?
The purpose of this program is to create a simple grid-based game where the player toggles the state of buttons within the grid. The objective of the game is to turn all buttons <span style="color:yellow;">yellow</span> which simulates turning lights on, hence the name "Lights On."
BONUS FACTOID: this little game is based on part of my final project in Grade 11 I made with Virtual Basic. It was hard as hell and I was genuinely impressed when someone actually managed to complete it, because I myself had to resort to googling an adjacency puzzle solver, and I still had to this time around. If you can beat it, more power to you.

## What would be sample input/output?
*Input*: Clicking on the buttons within the grid.
*Output*: Toggling the state of buttons between grey and yellow. Upon turning all buttons black, an alert message will be displayed. Beat the game to figure out what it says... or just cheat and look through the code...
